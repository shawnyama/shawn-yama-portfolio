I am Shawn and **guess what!** I can write websites. Now you may be wondering - "Why do you do write them?" Well since you're so curious: I find satisfaction in creating **easy to use software** that **engages and maybe even immerses** you. Designing/implementing new interfaces and user-experiences make the gears in my brain smile.

Nowadays, I am a Full-stack Engineer at [Uncharted](https://uncharted.software/) working on the [terarium](app.terarium.ai) project. On the side I am learning Godot game engine.
