I am Shawn - I create **easy to use software** that **engages and maybe even immerses** you. Designing/implementing new interfaces and user-experiences make the gears in my brain smile.

Nowadays, I am a Full-stack Engineer at [Uncharted](https://uncharted.software/) working on a knowledge, modeling and simulation ecosystem for researchers. On the side I am learning Godot game engine.
